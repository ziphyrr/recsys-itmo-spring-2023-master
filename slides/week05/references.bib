abstract = {Calibrated and intent-aware recommendation are recent approaches to recommendation
that have apparent similarities. Both try, to a certain extent, to cover the user's
interests, as revealed by her user profile. In this paper, we compare them in detail.
On two datasets, we show the extent to which intent-aware recommendations are calibrated
and the extent to which calibrated recommendations are diverse. We consider two ways
of defining a user's interests, one based on item features, the other based on subprofiles
of the user's profile. We find that defining interests in terms of subprofiles results
in highest precision and the best relevance/diversity trade-off. Along the way, we
define a new version of calibrated recommendation and three new evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {One of the long-standing questions in search systems is the role of diversity in results.
From a product perspective, showing diverse results provides the user with more choice
and should lead to an improved experience. However, this intuition is at odds with
common machine learning approaches to ranking which directly optimize the relevance
of each individual item without a holistic view of the result set. In this paper,
we describe our journey in tackling the problem of diversity for Airbnb search, starting
from heuristic based approaches and concluding with a novel deep learning solution
that produces an embedding of the entire query context by leveraging Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). We hope our lessons learned will prove useful to others and motivate
further research in this area.},

abstract = {The multi-armed bandit is an important framework for balancing exploration with exploitation
in recommendation. Exploitation recommends content (e.g., products, movies, music
playlists) with the highest predicted user engagement and has traditionally been the
focus of recommender systems. Exploration recommends content with uncertain predicted
user engagement for the purpose of gathering more information. The importance of exploration
has been recognized in recent years, particularly in settings with new users, new
items, non-stationary preferences and attributes. In parallel, explaining recommendations
("recsplanations") is crucial if users are to understand their recommendations. Existing
work has looked at bandits and explanations independently. We provide the first method
that combines both in a principled manner. In particular, our method is able to jointly
(1) learn which explanations each user responds to; (2) learn the best content to
recommend for each user; and (3) balance exploration with exploitation to deal with
uncertainty. Experiments with historical log data and tests with live production traffic
in a large-scale music recommendation service show a significant improvement in user
engagement.},

abstract = {Most data for evaluating and training recommender systems is subject to selection biases, either through self-selection by the users or through the actions of the recommendation system itself. In this paper, we provide a principled approach to handle selection biases by adapting models and estimation techniques from causal inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, and find that it is highly practical and scalable.},

abstract = {For a long time, different recommendation tasks require designing task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to transfer the knowledge and representations from one task to another, thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation approaches. To deal with such issues, considering that language can describe almost anything and language grounding is a powerful medium to represent various problems or tasks, we present a flexible and unified text-to-text paradigm called “Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Predict Paradigm” (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various recommendation tasks in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item interactions, user descriptions, item metadata, and user reviews are converted to a common format — natural language sequences. The rich information from natural language assists P5 to capture deeper semantics for personalization and recommendation. Specifically, P5 learns different tasks with the same language modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it serves as the foundation model for various downstream recommendation tasks, allows easy integration with other modalities, and enables instruction-based recommendation. P5 advances recommender systems from shallow model to deep model to big model, and will revolutionize the technical form of recommender systems towards universal recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized prompt for different users, P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or few-shot manner and largely reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On several benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of P5. To help advance future research on Recommendation as Language Processing (RLP), Personalized Foundation Models (PFM), and Universal Recommendation Engine (URE), we release the source code, dataset, prompts, and pretrained P5 model at https://github.com/jeykigung/P5.},
